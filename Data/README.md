# Capstone_project
This is the repository for the final assignment/project:

Cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. Companies with oversee location are often put into the position to make a strategic decision on where to locate regional headquarters. For this decision many factors such as taxation, labour and skill abundancy, political stability and experience with the region are essential decision variables.

For this Capstone assignment it is assumed that we consult a company in their decision process of choosing a location for their Europe headquarter. The company has pre-selected three cities in which a local office exists already:
- London (GBP)
- Zurich (CHE)
- Barcelona (SPA)

Each of these cities are attractive places to live and work. All are very close to international airports and are appreciated by Expats. The organisation wants to settle his new headquarter based on a decision matrix.

## Success criteria and audience:
The analysis is completed, if based on the obtained data set, a recommendation of the city and the borough in the city can be made and the board of directors can take a decision to move and initiate the project to set up the regional headquarter.

The decision takers are not interested in the actual data gathering but in the validity and roboustness of the findings to determin cost and prospects of the set up.
